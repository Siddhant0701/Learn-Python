# Numpy

It is a multidimensional array library.

It is faster because:
- Less memory because of fixed type
- No type checking is required
- Uses contiguous memory

Allows utilization SIMD Vector Processing Unit.
Effectively manage cache.

Numpy has a lot more functionality than standard python lists.


### Indexing 

Most of the indexing is just an extension of list indexing and slicing.
It is also possible to index using arrays.

### Array formation

`np.zeros()`
`np.ones()`
`np.full()`
`np.full_like()`
`np.random.rand() #Decimals`
`np.random.randInt() #Integers`


### Arithmetic

Element wise arithmetic is possible. 
Directly apply operations to np array to apply those operations to each individual element (Like map)   



### Linear Algebra

matrix operations
trace
determinant
eigenvalues
inverse

### Booleans

Boolean evaluation is also possible
& -> and
~ -> not
| -> or
